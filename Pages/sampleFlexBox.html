            CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages,
            including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the
            presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens,
            small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be
            used with any XML-based markup language.

            HTML and CSS are actually not technically programming languages;
            they're just page structure and style information. But before moving
            on to JavaScript and other true languages, you need to know the
            basics of HTML and CSS, as they are on the front end of every web
            page and application.

            On a fundamental level, yes, CSS is easy to learn. It might look
            messy and confusing, but the fundamentals can be learned very
            easily. CSS is easy to learn and get started with. However, CSS is
            unique in that the more you learn and the deeper you go, the more
            difficult and challenging it becomes.
